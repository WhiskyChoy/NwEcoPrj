\subsection{Solving Potential Problems}

\subsubsection{For the Model}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{$C_{ij}$ to/between High Risk Cities} 
    
    In our current model, we can describe the decision for the airline capicity from citis with high infection risk to those rather safer, but when deciding the airline capacity to or between high risk cities, it might require further consideration. In such conditions, our current model still keep some number of airlines, and it's up to the potential customers to decide whether to utilize such opportunity and go to high risk areas or not. 
    
    It make sense considering the demand of specific customers, but when considering the public health, the conclusion could be different. 
    \item \textbf{Other Representation of $S_{i}$:}
