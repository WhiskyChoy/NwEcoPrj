\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we focus on the assistant decision task for airline capacity control under pandemic like COVID-19. We try to model the tradeoff between the satisfaction of passengers' transportation demand and the avoidance of any further disease spreading. Our model reflects such tradeoff well and shows the difficulty of striking a balance. For getting opitmal solution we use both the IBM CPLEX solver and the Differential Evolution Algorithm, and we could get satisfactory result in the latter way. However, to answer the quesiton about anarchy penalty, that is, the negative influence of a unregulated aviation industry under global pandemic, we should further study how the capacity of aviation network could influence the infection severity in different cities with airports.
