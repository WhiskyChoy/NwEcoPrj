\section{Related Work}
Recently, researchers have done forecasting based upon data sources received from authenticated national and international sources. Effectiveness of forecasting is based upon the quality of data source used for forecasting. Forecasting results may vary based on the impurities in the data sources. Data mining and big data techniques always play a vital role for the forecast system\cite{huang2018air}. Previously, Giulia Giordano\cite{giordano2020sidarthe} has proposed the SIDARTHE Model that helps in redefining the reproduction number. This epidemic prediction model compares the infected density with the level of symptoms. Jia Wangping\cite{wangping2020extended} has presented a study in which, COVID-19 data from Jan 22, 2020, to Mar 16, 2020, has been used in time series form for analysis. Extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model. The prediction has been estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and results show that the reproductive number in Italy is 4.10 and 3.15 in Hunan. China has successfully used a variety of measures to control the COVID-19 such as controlling the public transportation\cite{shen2020prevention,kucharski2020early}. Based on these previous studies, we would like to use a model to solve the network flow problem of airline system for dynamic control, which might control the epidemic and bring less economic losses. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network flow problem}
    Network flow is a network that satisfies the following properties. Each edge has a maximum capacity C, which is the maximum flow that the edge can accommodate. f is the actual traffic flowing through the edge, and there is always f less or equal to C.
    \item \textbf{Minimum cost maximum flow problem}
The minimum cost maximum flow problem is a typical problem in economics and management. Each path in a network is limited by cost and capacity. These kind of research problems are mainly want to find out how to select the path and allocate the traffic passing through the path from a to B can achieve the minimum cost requirement.
    \item \textbf{Susceptible-infectious (SI) model }
    SI is the most basic epidemic model. S and I are Susceptible and Infectious respectively. This model assume that the susceptible person and the Infectious person effective contact is infected with Infectious person. SI model is one of the main methods to control and prevent infectious diseases. In different cases, we can add other kind of persons like exposed person and recover person, which can better illustrate different infectious diseases.
