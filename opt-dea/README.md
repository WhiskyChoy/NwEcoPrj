# A Simple Optimization Program for CIE6036 Project #
This is a repository for the solution to our project of the course CIE6036.
## Package Description ##
- The `/data` directory is for the storage of our data in the form of .csv file
- The `/result` directory stores the intermediates of the optimization program (if any)
- The `/output` directory stores the final output of the optimization program
- The `main.py` use **GeatPy** to solve a linear optimization problem
- The `result1.svg` tells the process of finding the optimality
## Program Setup ##
- Create a virtual python environment using conda: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run an executable .py file to get the result
